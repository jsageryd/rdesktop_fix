rdesktop fix
============

This is a workaround to have the AppGate java client run rdesktop in fullscreen mode with Swedish keyboard layout on Ubuntu through wrapping the rdesktop binary.

Usage
------------------
1. Put rdesktop in /usr/local/bin/

Disclaimer
------------------
I take no responsibility for this should it cause any harm.
